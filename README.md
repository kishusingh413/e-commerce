# e-commerce
In this app I have designed am e- commerce website,s basic database which included the relation between customer ,product and ordere. The seller can add new products to the database using mutation resolvers like addProduct. Similarly there are some other resolvers which can be used to create , update, delete products. Through the defined query a customer can fetch the product data and can order it through the addOrder resolver. There is a shcema.js file , in which, I have designed the schema for the database using GraphQL. It also includes different resolvers and export it from the module. My app.js file is main file which connect the port and run the website.
